# Leaderboard-Learnable

Created this project as my react task for learnable internship 2023.
The leaderboard shows a list of interns in their different tech tracks as well as their scores in each of the tasks given, at the end of the leaderboard there is a cummulative
score for each intern and it is arranged in descending order. The person with the highest score is highlighted in green and will be given an award by Learnable.
I focused more on the functionality than the UI for this task.
